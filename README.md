**"ECOCHAIN: HARNESSING  DATA SCIENCE TO MINIMIZE 
CARBON FOOTPRINT IN SUPPLY CHAINS"**
This study introduces a sophisticated data-driven system tailored for optimizing 
carbon emissions within industrial operations, with a specific emphasis on supply 
chain management. Leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies—
namely decision trees and random forests—the system meticulously evaluates 
CO2 equivalent (CO2e) contributions originating from various production 
components. Key functionalities encompass meticulous data pre-processing to 
calculate precise CO2e values, robust assessment of feature importance to 
pinpoint pivotal contributors, and the formulation of actionable 
recommendations.
The adopted machine learning algorithms offer distinct advantages: decision 
trees excel in elucidating complex relationships among production variables, 
while random forests enhance predictive accuracy by aggregating multiple 
decision trees. These attributes enable the system to deliver nuanced insights into 
carbon emissions dynamics within supply chains.
Recommendations stemming from the analysis advocate for strategic measures, 
thereby empowering organizations in the supply chain domain, this system aims 
to foster substantial reductions in environmental impact while bolstering 
operational resilience and adherence to sustainability goals
